/*The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

Examples

6   >=  6
7   >= '3'
2   >=  3
'7' >=  9
In order, these expressions would evaluate to true, true, false, and false.*/

//!Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense.

function testGreaterOrEqual(val) {
	if (val >= 20) {  // Change this line
		return "20 or Over";
	}

	if (val >= 10) {  // Change this line
		return "10 or Over";
	}

	return "Less than 10";
}

testGreaterOrEqual(10);
